## Overview

I love what I do, write code to bring stuff to life!

I'm a front-end developer based in Brazil, working for a company based in São Paulo. I also have a podcast called DevNaEstrada that we talk about web development with themes and interviews

I've been working as a developer (designer/programmer) since 2006, initially creating layout for websites, flash banners and a little back-end programmer and then, developing rich visual websites with focus in front-end.

I have worked on several projects where the back-end was in Java, Ruby, .Net, Python, PHP, but in most cases always with MVC frameworks.

Because my graduation I have an eye for design and ability to create pixel-perfect pages.
I have a knowledge in Material Design, create Styleguides and etc. 

- html5, cross-browser development
- css3, sass, less and styles for pre-processors ( ♥ sass + bourbon + neat )
- jquery, requirejs, rjs, mustache, handlebars, backbone
- Sublime/Atom my favorite editors
- grunt/gulp for task managers
- bash scripts (why not?)

Experience with remote work!

♥ HTML
♥ CSS
♥ JS
